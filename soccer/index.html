	  Soccer is a sport where you kick a ball. It is widely known around the world as football, but in the US it is called soccer. Soccer is an extremely important part of my life. I have grown up with it, and it has gotten me through many tough times. As I get older the more commited I get. My overall goal for soccer is to play D1 in college.
