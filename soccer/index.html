	  Soccer is a sport where you kick a ball. It is widely known around the world as football,
		  but in the US it is called soccer. Soccer is an extremely important part of my life.
	  I have grown up with it, and it has gotten me through many tough times. As I get older the more commited I get.
	  My overall goal for soccer is to play D1 in college. My dream school to play soccer at is Vanderbuilt. The team plays a lot like how I would like to, and the school is really good.
